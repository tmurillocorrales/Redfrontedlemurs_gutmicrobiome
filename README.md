These scripts were used to test the temporal drivers of the gut microbiome of wild redfronted lemurs living in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar. 

This project included the processing and analysis of 16S and 18S generated amplicons. The scripts for this analysis can be found in the 
respective folders including their metadata. The ASV tables for the analyis can downloaded from Figshare:

18S_BLCA_ASV_table -> DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.19095995

The results from this analysis were submitted for peer review.
