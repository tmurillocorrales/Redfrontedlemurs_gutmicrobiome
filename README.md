# Redfrontedlemurs_gutmicrobiome
These scripts were used to test the temporal drivers of the gut microbiome of wild redfronted lemurs living in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar. 

This project included the processing and analysis of 16S and 18S generated amplicons. The scripts for this analysis can be found in the 
respective folders including their metadata. The ASV tables for the analysis can downloaded from Figshare: 

16S_ASV_table.txt -> https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19095968.v1

18S_BLCA_ASV_table ->  https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19095995.v1

Additionally linear mixed models and social networks analysis were performed. The R scripts and data frames can be found in the respective folders.

The results from this project were submitted for peer review.
